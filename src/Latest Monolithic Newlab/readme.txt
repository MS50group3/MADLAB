Use these files to access the current set of functions and structs that constitute the basic engine of the game.

The basic idea:

You: "I can't wait to build that new feature. I guess i need to draw it to the screen somehow"

This folder: "Hey why don't you download these files and see if someone already wrote that function for you"

You: "Oh sweet that's saved me loads of time. I won't need to rewrite anything, and it'll integrate easier"

Folder: "Yeah. Just #include "newlab-version.h" and you're set"

You: "Thanks folder, I love you"
