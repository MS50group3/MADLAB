The game now integrates a LOGO interpreter as a bonus feature from the main menu.

The source code for the interpreter is part of a different ongoing and individial assignment from the course. Students are not allowed to share assessment source code, and as such the interpreter.c source file is not shared here. Instead it has been compiled into raw output interpreter.o which madlab.o can compile against.

See the makefile for more details.
