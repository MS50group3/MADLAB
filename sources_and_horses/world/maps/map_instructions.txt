At some point instructions on how to make maps will be here. 

For now, it's just some text telling you what will happen in the future. 

...not unlike a crystal ball in many ways. 

But the maps will be used for blocking (in the stage/theatre/film sense)
the rooms. 

0000000
0000110
0000000
0010000
0010000

So basically the 1s would represent a place the sprite could not go. 

Issues:

- work out map sizes and screen size
