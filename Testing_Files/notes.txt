Coding notes:

In draw_room: 

Why is it not else if in the loop.
Why is there no action if the array isn't zero or one.

In movement:

No default for switch.

In initialise_problem:

Could put a clause saying the number of instructions has to make sense.

In chicken walks:

Could this be incorporated into the regular walking function?

In ChickenChangeDirection:

Nothing to catch if the chicken is going in an unspecified direction.
