Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Aaron Ceross (@aceross), Mallory Earnshaw (@makow), Maria Arenas (@ma14582), Mary Lin (@minidietcoke), @JamesCollerton, and Sam Low (@s-low) at the University of Bristol, UK.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
